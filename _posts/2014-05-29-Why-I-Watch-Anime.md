Anime like Clannad After Story give a sacred radiance to a kind of warmth. They paint a warm picture of humanity. Portray people as warm people who offer themselves in support of their peers. Conferring warmth. They conceive of conflicts and problems and death and sorrow as inevitable waves upon the tides of life, that are faced, battled, and overcome with unselfish love, genuine care. The warmth of human interactions. A warm world where amidst the inexorable hardships people are good, loving, kind.

A warmth that people, perhaps rightfully, deride as unrealistic. That real people do not subscribe to, do not believe in, thus deepening the rift between the vision of warmth and the coldness of reality. And this in its turn, accentuating, justifying, the derision of that warmth. **All lies.**

But I believe in that lie.

So I watch anime.
